- **Infrastructure as Code:** Terraform · Ansible  
- **CI/CD & Automation:** Jenkins · GitHub Actions · GitLab CI · SonarQube · Nexus · JFrog Artifactory

- **Scripting & Configuration:** Bash · Python · YAML  

🎯 I’m currently working at **PCCW Global (Console Connect)**, managing AWS resources and supporting CI/CD pipelines for large-scale deployments. My goal is to continually improve automation and reliability across multi-cloud environments.

💡 I’m also a lifelong learner—currently deepening my knowledge in **serverless architectures**, **cloud security**, and **infrastructure automation**.
